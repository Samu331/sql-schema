FROM flights f
JOIN airports a1 ON f.departure_airport_id = a1.airport_id
JOIN airports a2 ON f.arrival_airport_id = a2.airport_id
WHERE a1.iata_code = 'JNB' AND a2.iata_code = 'CPT';

-- Total baggage weight per flight
SELECT f.flight_number, SUM(b.weight_kg) AS total_weight
FROM baggage b
JOIN tickets t ON b.ticket_id = t.ticket_id
JOIN flights f ON t.flight_id = f.flight_id
GROUP BY f.flight_number;
